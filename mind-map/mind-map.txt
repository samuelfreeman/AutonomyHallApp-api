entities
admin
student 
hall
room 
roomrequest 
allocation





flow:
student registers him/herself
student makes payment 
student makes a room request via the mobile application


admin sees all requests 
admin accepts all requests
admin allocate rooms for students 
admin add rooms
admin view room analytics 








new implementation :

allocation of room to students have to be automatic



roomrequest and allocation  should become one 




 when student makes a room-request 
 


 we first check  for  available  rooms 
: we can go into the database and look for rooms where 
the status is not occupied 
 



 then we  get the room id 
 then we take the students id 
 we create a new allocation  by assigning student to room id 

 this will make the process very automatic 



 i am pondring wether the room request entity is really needed 
 i think yes so we can track how  many roomrequests the students has made 
 so we can decide wether we should limit it or not maybe limiting it to 
 about 4  successfull requests.
 i am also think of making this a database transaction.






another implementation
All rooms will be taken as occupied if the 
room has 4 students



look for rooms where their  allocation count is four 
then we update those rooms status to 'occupied'
