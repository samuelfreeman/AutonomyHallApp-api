entities:
admin
student 
hall
room 
roomrequest 
allocation





flow:
student registers him/herself
student makes payment 
student makes a room request via the mobile application 
so when student submits a room request , automaically they will be assigined to a room

admin sees all requests 
admin accepts all requests
admin allocate rooms for students 
admin add rooms
admin view room analytics 




new implementation :

allocation of room to students have to be automatic



roomrequest and allocation  should become one 




 when student makes a room-request 
 


 we first check  for  available  rooms 
: we can go into the database and look for rooms where 
the status is not occupied 
 



 then we  get the room id 
 then we take the students id 
 we create a new allocation  by assigning student to room id 

 this will make the process very automatic 



 i am pondring wether the room request entity is really needed 
 i think yes so we can track how  many roomrequests the students has made 
 so we can decide wether we should limit it or not maybe limiting it to 
 about 4  successfull requests.
 i am also think of making this a database transaction but it will be probablly best to implement it when i integrate the payment api to it .







another implementation
All rooms will be taken as occupied if the 
room has 4 students



look for rooms where their  allocation count is four 
then we update those rooms status to 'occupied' 





The first role on my application is that students should be able 

Students can  register  for the hall app  providing all the necessary requirements.
But they must be an affliate of the hall first.


i am pondering wether the hall entity is needed since its for just one hall which is autonomy
then how will i get the number of rooms - by doing analytics on the room
